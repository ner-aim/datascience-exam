    "    Since the number of features are way higher than that of the class, each of the features needs to be determined with the response variable. For this univariate analysis, there are a number of methods that can be used. The easiest and direct way for the procedure is using Pearson's Correlation to generate high and low noise of the feature and comparing with itself. We compare the p-values of the features and generate correlations with respect to the response variable. Although this works for a linear relationship between the variables. This fails for non-linear variables. \n",

Pearson's correlation works well with smaller datasets, but assuming this is a medoicre dataset and all the features are numerical, we can say that Distance Correlation will do a great job. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* \n",
    "##### Step 2:\n",
    "    Now that we have a good subset we need to split the data into train and test. The normal way would be using 70% and 30% ratio of the splitting the dataset. Although this can cause further problems, like overfitting of bias towards a single kind of label. To ensure the data has been split into proper proportions, we require the data split to be uniform and have class distributions similar to the process of handling Big Data. So we split the data into Train, Validation and Test set. As usual, we train the dataset and outline the work by using the validation set at each epoch or Cross validation to determine the model performance. Later on, the testing set is used to determine the nature of the model.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    Since we are using the validation set, a bunch of multiclassification models can be used to determine the best for the task. As a general rule of thumb, because all the features are numeric, tree models can be used to determine the task, assuming there is no nulls, outliers and the sample is perfectly balanced. Regardless of the sample being balanced, which is generally not the case with multiclass classification. So we can use oversampling for training the dataset. Training and validation can be done be using the tree models and Boosting models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoosting etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "*\n",
    "##### Step 3:\n",
    "    Now that we have a good classifier using the hyperparameters working on the good validation set, we need to test the model on the testing set. If the validation error is low i.e. the model performs well on the training data, and the generalization error is high, the model is overfitting on the training dataset. To avoid that, we need to get the hyperparameters properly and assign it to the testing data. We can calculate the generalization error as $E_gen = \\int error(f_d(x),y)p(y,x)dx$, p(y,x) is how often we see y,x. This is the optimistic error generalization. We compare it with different cross-validation of different algorithms."
